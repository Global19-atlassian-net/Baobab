# Contributing

## Process
- Request access to the repository by completing this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee_7ID0N-fvdE3owDpoIJ69PDcGFrpbClbxusxLU2bj58BYw/viewform).
- Have a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab/issues) tab to identify something you would be interested in working on. If you spot an issue assigned to someone else, that meets your particular skill set, feel free to leave a comment stating your capacity to help. 
- Assign yourself to the issue (or create a new issue if an appropriate one doesn't exist).
- Create a branch to make your changes (see [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) if you're not familar with git branching. For git commit best practices, have a look at this [guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) as well. Other developers (including your future self!) will thank you.

    For those more familiar with git, branches on the main repository are preferred over forks since the automated tests only run there.
- Each issue has a _Definition of Done_ which is intended to be a checklist of things to consider.
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into **develop**. 
- Ensure that your tests pass on CircleCI (you will see a status saying "All checks have passed" on the Pull Request page). If you see a messaging saying "All checks have failed", follow the link to CircleCI by clicking on the Details link to see which tests are failing and fix the issue with additional commits. 
- Your pull request will need to be approved by Jade, Kale-ab, Amrit, or Avishkar before it can be merged.

- Don't worry if you are not too familiar with the technologies or conventions used - we can iterate during the pull request review process. This is intended to be a learning opportunity for all of us! 
    - If you aren't sure how to even get started, we have some tutorials to help narrow the search space:
    - [How to write your first line of code for Baobab](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab/blob/develop/api/baobab_tutorial.md): a summary of how to get your PC up and running to be able to access the code
    - [Glossary of useful concepts](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab/blob/develop/api/glossary_usefulconcepts.md): This is currently focused on the back-end technologies, to help familiarise you with some the concepts used to create and maintain Baobab
