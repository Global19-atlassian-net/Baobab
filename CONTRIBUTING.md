# Contributing

## Process
- Request access to the repository by completing this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee_7ID0N-fvdE3owDpoIJ69PDcGFrpbClbxusxLU2bj58BYw/viewform).
- Have a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab/issues) tab to identify something you would be intersted in working on. If you spot an issue assigned to someone else, that meets your particular skill set, feel free to leave a comment stating your capacity to help. 
- Assign yourself to the issue (or create a new issue if an appropriate one doesn't exist).
- Create a branch for to make your changes (see [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) if you're not familar with git branching). For those more familiar with git, branches on the main repository are preferred over forks since the automated tests only run there.
- Each issue has a _Definition of Done_ which is intended to be a checklist of things to consider.
- Create a pull request to merge your changes into **develop**. 
- Ensure that your tests pass on CircleCI (you will see a status saying "All checks have passed" on the Pull Request page). If you see a messaging saying "All checks have failed", follow the link to CircleCI by clicking on the Details link to see which tests are failing and fix the issue with additional commits. 
- Your pull request will need to be approved by Jade, Kale-ab or Avishkar before it can be merged.

- Don't worry if you are not too familiar with the technologies or conventions used - we can iterate during the pull request review process. This is intended to be a learning opportunity for all of us!
